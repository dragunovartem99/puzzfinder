Discover hidden gems in Lichess' multi-million puzzle database with fast, filter-based searches

The project consists of three components:

- [Client-side web interface](https://github.com/dragunovartem99/puzzfinder)
- [Application programming interface](https://github.com/dragunovartem99/puzzfinder-api)
- [SQLite database with chess puzzles](https://github.com/dragunovartem99/puzzfinder-db)

Any server-side advice/help will be very welcomed! This is my first full-stack project.
